# 28DaysTerraformLearning
This repository contains comprehensive learning materials, hands-on labs, and practical examples from my Terraform education journey focused on Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. As an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, Terraform enables the declarative provisioning and management of Azure resources at scale.

## ðŸ“š What I've Learned

### Core Terraform Concepts
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** fundamentals and best practices
- Terraform architecture, providers, and state management
- HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax and structure
- Resource lifecycle management and dependency handling

### Azure-Specific Implementation
- **Azure Provider (AzureRM)** configuration and authentication methods
- **Resource Groups** and Azure resource organization
- **Virtual Networks (VNets)**, subnets, and network security groups
- **Virtual Machines** provisioning with custom configurations
- **Azure Storage Accounts** and blob storage management
- **App Services** and web application deployments

### Advanced Azure Topics
- **Azure Key Vault** integration for secrets management
- **Azure Active Directory** and service principal authentication
- **Load Balancers** and traffic distribution
- **Azure Database** services (SQL Database, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Azure Container Instances** and containerized workloads
- **Azure Functions** serverless compute resources

### Terraform Best Practices
- **State management** with Azure Storage backend
- **Modules** creation for reusable Azure infrastructure patterns
- **Workspaces** for multi-environment management (dev/staging/prod)
- **Variables and outputs** for dynamic configurations
- **Data sources** for referencing existing Azure resources

### DevOps Integration
- **Azure DevOps** pipeline integration with Terraform
- **CI/CD workflows** for infrastructure deployment
- **Plan and apply** strategies for safe infrastructure changes
- **Drift detection** and state reconciliation
- **Security scanning** and compliance validation

## ðŸ›  Technologies Covered
- Terraform CLI and Azure Provider
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) integration
- Azure CLI for authentication and resource management
- Visual Studio Code with Terraform and Azure extensions
- Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines
- Azure Storage for remote state management
